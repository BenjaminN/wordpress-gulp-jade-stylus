+ Move to the newly created directory and run `npm install`
+ Then run `gulp` once to download the latest Wordpress release
+ Copy `themes/default-skeleton` into `themes/your-theme`
+ Edit `themes/your-theme/config.json` file as you wish (view more on the [Wordpress Codex](https://codex.wordpress.org/File_Header))
